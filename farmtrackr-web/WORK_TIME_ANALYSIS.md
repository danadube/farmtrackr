## Methodology

The analysis is based on:
1. **Git commit timestamps** - First and last commit of each day
2. **Time span calculation** - Difference between first and last commit
3. **Conservative estimation**:
   - Days with single commits: 0.5 hours (quick fixes)
   - Days with multiple commits: Time span × 1.2 (accounts for breaks/gaps)
   - Maximum capped at 8 hours per day (standard work day)

**Note:** This is a conservative estimate. Actual time may be slightly higher if:
- Work was done without committing
- Multiple distinct sessions per day (already accounted for by span)
- Code review/testing time not reflected in commits
