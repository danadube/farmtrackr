## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Above All

Every interface element should have a clear purpose. If a feature doesn't help agents manage their properties more effectively, it shouldn't be there. Remove decoration; add value.

### 2. Respect the User's Time

Real estate agents are busy. Design for efficiency. Common tasks should take minimal clicks. Critical information should be visible at a glance. Loading states should reassure, not frustrate.

### 3. Consistent, Not Boring

Use patterns and conventions consistently, but don't sacrifice visual interest. Our color-coding system provides functional variety within a consistent framework. Patterns create familiarity; color creates engagement.

### 4. Mobile-First, Always

Agents work on the go—at showings, open houses, and client meetings. Design for mobile first, then scale up. Touch targets must be large enough. Text must be readable without zooming. Actions must work with one hand.

### 5. Accessible by Default

Accessibility isn't an add-on. Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratios. Support keyboard navigation. Provide alt text. Design for screen readers. Everyone deserves great tools.

### 6. Delight in the Details

Smooth animations. Subtle hover effects. Thoughtful micro-interactions. These details don't just look good—they communicate that we care about quality and that agents can trust our platform.

### Design System Specifications

| Element | Specification | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Grid System** | 8-point base unit | All spacing in multiples of 8px |
| **Border Radius** | Small: 8px, Medium: 12px, Large: 16px | Consistent rounded corners |
| **Shadows** | Subtle, layered (Apple) or standard (Orchard) | Never harsh |
| **Animation Duration** | 200-300ms | Fast but visible |
| **Animation Easing** | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) | Apple-style |
| **Touch Targets** | Minimum 44x44px | iOS guidelines |
| **Max Content Width** | 1400px | Optimal reading width |
